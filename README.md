# Crafting Interpreters book

This repo is my follow through of the book "Crafting Interpreters" by
Robert Nystrom. The companion site for the book is here: https://craftinginterpreters.com/


## Generate AST

Beginning in Chapter 5, we do some metaprogramming and create a script that
generates classes that represent our AST of expressions. This AST is defined
in `com/craftinginterpreters/lox/Expr.java`. I'll keep the latest version checked
in to the repo, but the latest can always be regenerated by running:

```$ just generate_ast```

This will overwrite the current `Expr.java` file in the `lox` folder.
